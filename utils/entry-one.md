# Excerpt from _Between the World and Me_ by Ta-Nehisi Coates, Page 14

> It was always right in front of me. The fear was there in the extravagant boys in my neighborhood, in their large rings and medallions, their big puffy coats and their full-length fur-collared leathers, which was their armor against the world. They would stand on the corner of Gwynn Oak and Liberty, or Cold Spring and Park Heights, or outside the Mondawmin Mall, with their hands dipped in Russel sweats. I think back on those boys now and all I see is fear, and all I see is them girding themselves against the ghost of the bad old days when the Mississippi mob gathered ‘round their grandfathers so that the branches of the black body might be torched, then cut away. The fear lived on in their practiced bop, their slouching denim, their big t-shirts, the calculated angle of their baseball caps, a catalog of behaviors and garments enlisted to inspire the belief that these boys were in firm possession of everything they desired.

## What I Noticed

- the author recounts a childhood story with adult perspective
- the teenagers’ clothing is described with grandeur
- the author avoids commas between adjectives making the text feel faster-paced
- the grandeur of these teenagers is juxtaposed with their vulnerability
- the relaxed clothing and confident behavior is in contrast with constant fear
- Coates conjures the stereotype of a black teenager as confident, aggressive, extravagantly dressed, but subverts this stereotype by analyzing the fear that these boys were trying to cope with in their behavior and expression

## Making Meaning from Evidence

One of the most stereotyped groups of people is young, black men. Media depictions often paint the image of a confident, aggressive black teenager in streetwear who acts tough and doesn’t have a care in the world. This stereotype has had a huge impact on the way in which society sees black teenagers and has been the source of unfounded racial fears. In Between the World and Me, Coates subverts this stereotype by recounting childhood memories. He describes the extravagantly-dressed young black men which he viewed as powerful as a young child. But in revisiting his memory of these men, he dissects how the facade of power and confidence these men exhibited was a method of coping with the intense fear and vulnerability they faced every day as black men. Coates argues that the aggressive behavior that black teenagers are often stereotyped as exhibiting is a form of trying to take back power, a way to feel ownership of their bodies in spite of oppression. He examines how they’ve carried the fear that their grandfathers felt in the days of lynching. The juxtaposition of relaxed clothing and fear is how Coates demonstrates his awareness of the stereotype and his response to it.
What’s particularly powerful about this passage is that the reader rethinks their subconscious expectations of which they may not have been aware before reading this passage. The reader is now primed to question their inherent biases and preconceived notions about African Americans. After reading this passage, the reader now realizes that these teenagers are not aggressive or mean, but scared and vulnerable.

## Placing Meaning in Context

An important aspect of my analysis is that it helped understand the black experience from the inside perspective rather than outside. I felt a much stronger understanding of African-American culture after breaking down this passage, which made me realize how much of black culture is the result of having to cope with constant fear and degradation. Analyzing the full text in depth reveals the purpose of this book to give the reader an understanding of the individual black experience. Coates further delves into this point in the next page, discussing the relation between body ownership and the etiquette of street brawls. I think the main point of what Coates is trying to say is “This is how it feels,”.
