# Excerpt from *Between the World and Me* by Ta-Nehisi Coates, Page 14

>It was always right in front of me. The fear was there in the extravagant boys in my neighborhood, in their large rings and medallions, their big puffy coats and their full-length fur-collared leathers, which was their armor against the world. They would stand on the corner of Gwynn Oak and Liberty, or Cold Spring and Park Heights, or outside the Mondawmin Mall, with their hands dipped in Russel sweats. I think back on those boys now and all I see is fear, and all I see is them girding themselves against the ghost of the bad old days when the Mississippi mob gathered ‘round their grandfathers so that the branches of the black body might be torched, then cut away. The fear lived on in their practiced bop, their slouching denim, their big t-shirts, the calculated angle of their baseball caps, a catalog of behaviors and garments enlisted to inspire the belief that these boys were in firm possession of everything they desired.

## What I Noticed
- the author recounts a childhood story with adult perspective
- the teenagers’ clothing is described with grandeur
- the author avoids commas between adjectives making the text feel faster-paced 
- the grandeur of these teenagers is juxtaposed with their vulnerability
- the relaxed clothing and confident behavior is in contrast with constant fear
- Coates conjures the stereotype of a black teenager as confident, aggressive, extravagantly dressed, but subverts this stereotype by analyzing the fear that these boys were trying to cope with in their behavior and expression

## Making Meaning from Evidence
One of the most stereotyped groups of people is young, black men. Media depictions often paint the image of a confident, aggressive black teenager in streetwear who acts tough and doesn’t have a care in the world. This stereotype has had a huge impact on the way in which society sees black teenagers and has been the source of unfounded racial fears. In *Between the World and Me*, Coates subverts this stereotype while revisiting a childhood anecdote. He describes the extravagantly-dressed young black men in his neighborhood which he viewed as powerful when he was a young child. But in revisiting his memory of these men, he dissects how the facade of power and confidence these men exhibited was a method of coping with the intense fear and vulnerability they faced every day as black men. Coates argues that the aggressive behavior that black teenagers are often stereotyped as exhibiting is a form of trying to take back power, a way to feel ownership of their bodies in spite of oppression. He examines how they’ve carried the fear that their grandfathers felt in the days of lynching. The juxtaposition of relaxed clothing and fear is how Coates demonstrates his awareness of the stereotype and his response to it.
What’s particularly powerful about this passage is that the reader rethinks their subconscious expectations of which they may not have been aware before reading this passage. The reader is now primed to question their inherent biases and preconceived notions about African Americans. After reading this passage, the reader now realizes that these teenagers are not aggressive or mean, but scared and vulnerable.

## Placing Meaning in Context
An important aspect of my analysis is that it helped understand the black experience from the inside perspective rather than outside. I felt a much stronger understanding of African-American culture after breaking down this passage, which made me realize how much of black culture is the result of having to cope with constant fear and degradation. Analyzing the full text in depth reveals the purpose of this book to give the reader an understanding of the individual black experience. Coates further delves into this point in the next page, discussing the relation between body ownership and the etiquette of street brawls. I think the main point of what Coates is trying to say is “This is how it feels,”.

# Excerpt from Teju Cole's "The Black Lives Matter Superhero Photographs"
>The movies are not the most subtle world cinema has to offer, but superheroes are a cultural force. They fill a psychological need in a world of drift and inchoate war. They have also, along the way, become powerful elements in any contemporary sense of visuality.
The relationship between superhero movies and the photographs from Black Lives Matter is not a matter of photographers trying to make protesters look like superheroes. It is that when such photographs emerge from the countless thousands taken at rallies and similar events, they are immediately recognized by a crowd already sensitized to their formal qualities.

## What I Noticed
- makes me think about the rise of superhero popularity and how it relates to current world affairs
- I had never really thought about why clean-cut good vs. evil stories are so popular
- it is interesting how people search out familiarity in nonfiction media

## Making Meaning from Evidence
This passage from Teju Cole’s article dissects the human need to bridge the gap between familiar media and real-life. The image of a superhero standing alone against some great evil is recognized by almost all Americans, and tends to focus on the might of a superhero’s powers or strength. However, the Black Lives Matter Superhero Photograph depicts a hero whose bravery comes from calmness and courage, not might. This subverts the common association between power and physical might and allows the viewer to reconsider what power means.
Another interesting subversion of reader expectations is that the heroic figure in this photograph is a black woman. The majority of popular superheroes are white males, which subconsciously breeds the association between whiteness, masculinity, and bravery. Black women are extremely underrepresented in this genre, so it grabs the reader’s attention to see a black, female superhero figure.

## Placing Meaning in Context
I think there are two connected main arguments in this article. The first is the connection between the superhero genre and the power conflicts in real-life. People feel an inherent need to familiarize the complicated issues in the world, and one of the ways in which they do that is by drawing connections to the media. A detail Cole mentioned that was very fascinating to me was the correlation between ongoing armed conflicts and superhero movies. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were confusing and unclear to many Americans, so they turned to superhero movies with a clean-cut line between good and evil and an obvious purpose to fight.
The second point into which Cole delves is the representation of black women in the media. A superhero is what most obviously comes to mind when one is thinking of a symbol of good in fiction. The fact that these figures are predominantly white males reinforces racism by creating positive connotations related to whiteness and reinforces sexism by playing into the idea that society is not comfortable with powerful women. These images are a great counter to the underrepresentation of black women which also remind us of the reality of the ongoing civil rights struggle.
