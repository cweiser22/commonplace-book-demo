# Excerpt from Teju Cole's "The Black Lives Matter Superhero Photographs"

> The movies are not the most subtle world cinema has to offer, but superheroes are a cultural force. They fill a psychological need in a world of drift and inchoate war. They have also, along the way, become powerful elements in any contemporary sense of visuality.
> The relationship between superhero movies and the photographs from Black Lives Matter is not a matter of photographers trying to make protesters look like superheroes. It is that when such photographs emerge from the countless thousands taken at rallies and similar events, they are immediately recognized by a crowd already sensitized to their formal qualities.

## What I Noticed

- makes me think about the rise of superhero popularity and how it relates to current world affairs
- I had never really thought about why clean-cut good vs. evil stories are so popular
- it is interesting how people search out familiarity in nonfiction media

## Making Meaning from Evidence

This passage from Teju Cole’s article dissects the human need to bridge the gap between familiar media and real-life. The image of a superhero standing alone against some great evil is recognized by almost all Americans, and tends to focus on the might of a superhero’s powers or strength. However, the Black Lives Matter Superhero Photograph depicts a hero whose bravery comes from calmness and courage, not might. This subverts the common association between power and physical might and allows the viewer to reconsider what power means.
Another interesting subversion of reader expectations is that the heroic figure in this photograph is a black woman. The majority of popular superheroes are white males, which subconsciously breeds the association between whiteness, masculinity, and bravery. Black women are extremely underrepresented in this genre, so it grabs the reader’s attention to see a black, female superhero figure.

## Placing Meaning in Context

I think there are two connected main arguments in this article. The first is the connection between the superhero genre and the power conflicts in real-life. People feel an inherent need to familiarize the complicated issues in the world, and one of the ways in which they do that is by drawing connections to the media. A detail Cole mentioned that was very fascinating to me was the correlation between ongoing armed conflicts and superhero movies. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were confusing and unclear to many Americans, so they turned to superhero movies with a clean-cut line between good and evil and an obvious purpose to fight.
The second point into which Cole delves is the representation of black women in the media. A superhero is what most obviously comes to mind when one is thinking of a symbol of good in fiction. The fact that these figures are predominantly white males reinforces racism by creating positive connotations related to whiteness and reinforces sexism by playing into the idea that society is not comfortable with powerful women. These images are a great counter to the underrepresentation of black women which also remind us of the reality of the ongoing civil rights struggle.
